Breaks Down Fats Cells Faster</h3><p>Ugly fat locked in cells around your belly, thighs, upper arms, and facehas to be broken down into fatty acids before it can be released. But if you’ve been 5,10, or 20 kg overweight for some time, your body’s natural ability to convert fat into fatty acids may have broken down.<br>Postburn contains ingredients that help get it working again. So fat can be converted into energy bars all over your body.</p><ul><li><p>A study published in Food Science and Biotechnology showedthat an ingredient found in Postburn helps the body to increase its production of free fatty acids.[1]</p></li><li><p>A study by Arizona State University found that capsaicinincreases the breakdown of fats and boosts energy as a result.[2]</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="div c__black"><div class="col-xs-12"><div class="row pd__10"><div class="bg__white pd__25 card shadow"><h3 class="mb__40">2. Enhances Metabolism of Free Fatty Acids</h3><p>After stored fat is broken down into free fatty acids, it has to be burnedoff as energy. This process is called “oxidation”. But if oxidation isn’t working properly the free fatty acids get locked away again as lumps of ugly fat. Postburn contains ingredients found to be potent at increasing oxidation, so that more free fatty acids get turned into fuel.</p><ul><li><p>A study by the University of Nottingham Medical School, Queen&#39;sMedical Centre, showed that acetyl L-carnitine in Postburn increases fat oxidation so that you gain more energy and can workout for longer.[3]</p></li><li><p>A study led by Berlain M, from the Medical and ClinicalPharmacology Laboratory in France, found that the ingredient yohimbe drives more fatty acids into your cells’ power plants (called mitochondria) for a greater release of energy.[4]</p></li><li><p>Green tea extract in Postburn was found to trigger energy usageof free fatty acids by as much as 750 kJ in 24 hours in a study by Laval University, Canada.[5]</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><div class="div c__black"><div class="col-xs-12"><div class="row pd__10"><div class="bg__white pd__25 card shadow"><h3 class="mb__40">3. Reduces Fat Storage</h3><p>Weight loss can only happen if your body is burning more fat than itstores. The worst culprit for creating fat is sugar. So we developed Postburn with a third mechanism that reduces how much sugar is absorbed to prevent it being stored as fat.</p><ul><li><p>A study published in the Obesity Medical Journal found that 40subjects who took yerba mate for 2 months reduced their fat buildup by 30%.[6]</p></li><li><p>A study by the ETC Research and Development, Norway, foundthat consuming green coffee bean extract for 3 months plummeted sugar absorption by a significant 6.9%. The subjects also lost more than 5 kg on average.[7]</p></li><li><p>Researchers from the University of Udine, Italy, found thatrhodiola rosea disarms multiple fat formation triggers, such as FGF2 and PPARG.[8]</p></li></ul><h3></h3><p>Just one of these fat loss mechanisms can make a huge difference to your weight loss efforts. When you combine all three you can putyourself on the fast track to releasing stored fat, converting it into energy, and emptying your stores of fat to gain the slimmer, healthier, and sexier body you’ve always wanted.</p></div></div></div></div><p></p></div><button class="ch-btn center-xs middle-xs bg__green c__white f__bold" id="order">Postburn 4-Bottle Bundle to your order for just $120.00<i class="fa fa-arrow-right sp__left-1"></i></button></div></div></div><div class="bg__white section__80"><div class="container"><div class="row middle-xs center-xs"><div class="col-xs-11 col-md-8"><h1 class="mb__40 c__dark-orange">74% of customers add Postburn to their Purchase</h1><div class="row center-xs mt__40 mb__40"><div class="col xs-12 col-md-8"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2060/5733/files/cart_hook_postburn_4_bottles_1024x1024.png" alt="Image Title" style="width:100%;"></div></div><h1 class="mb__40 c__dark-orange">Postburn is the Accelerate for Your Gut’s Fat Burning Engine</h1><p>Imagine your body is an engine.
