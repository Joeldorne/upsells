                    p Ugly fat locked in cells around your belly, thighs, upper arms, and face
                        | has to be broken down into fatty acids before it can be released.
                        | But if you’ve been 5,10, or 20 kg overweight for some time, your body’s
                        | natural ability to convert fat into fatty acids may have broken down.
                        br
                        | Postburn contains ingredients that help get it working again. So fat can
                        | be converted into energy bars all over your body.

                        li 
                            p A study published in Food Science and Biotechnology showed
                                | that an ingredient found in Postburn helps the body to increase
                                | its production of free fatty acids.[1]
                        li 
                            p A study by Arizona State University found that capsaicin
                                | increases the breakdown of fats and boosts energy as a
                                | result.[2]

                    h1 2. Enhances Metabolism of Free Fatty Acids

                    p After stored fat is broken down into free fatty acids, it has to be burned
                        | off as energy. This process is called “oxidation”. But if oxidation isn’t
                        | working properly the free fatty acids get locked away again as lumps of
                        | ugly fat. Postburn contains ingredients found to be potent at increasing
                        | oxidation, so that more free fatty acids get turned into fuel.

                            p A study by the University of Nottingham Medical School, Queen&#39;s
                                | Medical Centre, showed that acetyl L-carnitine in Postburn
                                | increases fat oxidation so that you gain more energy and can
                                | workout for longer.[3]
                        li
                            p A study led by Berlain M, from the Medical and Clinical
                                | Pharmacology Laboratory in France, found that the ingredient
                                | yohimbe drives more fatty acids into your cells’ power plants
                                | (called mitochondria) for a greater release of energy.[4]
                        li 
                            p Green tea extract in Postburn was found to trigger energy usage
                                | of free fatty acids by as much as 750 kJ in 24 hours in a study by
                                | Laval University, Canada.[5]

                h1 3. Reduces Fat Storage

                p Weight loss can only happen if your body is burning more fat than it
                    | stores. The worst culprit for creating fat is sugar. So we developed
                    | Postburn with a third mechanism that reduces how much sugar is
                    | absorbed to prevent it being stored as fat.
                ul 
                    li 
                        p A study published in the Obesity Medical Journal found that 40
                            | subjects who took yerba mate for 2 months reduced their fat
                            | buildup by 30%.[6]
                    li 
                        p A study by the ETC Research and Development, Norway, found
                            | that consuming green coffee bean extract for 3 months
                            | plummeted sugar absorption by a significant 6.9%. The
                            | subjects also lost more than 5 kg on average.[7]
                    li
                        p Researchers from the University of Udine, Italy, found that
                            | rhodiola rosea disarms multiple fat formation triggers, such as
                            | FGF2 and PPARG.[8]
                // Section 
                h1
                p Just one of these fat loss mechanisms can make a huge difference to your weight loss efforts. When you combine all three you can put
                    | yourself on the fast track to releasing stored fat, converting it into
                    | energy, and emptying your stores of fat to gain the slimmer, healthier,
                    | and sexier body you’ve always wanted.
